This tool combines two versions of the data.dat file used by the [Solgryn's Pok√©mon On Stream](https://www.grynsoft.com/spos-app/) app.

Combines:
- Trainer caught Pokemon (preserving shinies in either file)
- Trainer ultra ball count
- Trainer stats

The following are copied from data-old.dat:
- Trainer team data
- Trainer avatar

## Instructions:

1. Make sure the Solgryn app is closed

2. Download the release .zip and extract it somewhere

2. Find the data.dat file for the solgryn app in your AppData path like:
`C:\Users\your-username\AppData\LocalLow\Grynsoft\Solgryns Pokemon On Twitch`

3. Take the newer copy of the file, make a copy called "data-new.dat", and put it where you extracted the zip

4. Take the older copy of the file, make a copy and call it "data-old.dat", and put it where you extracted the zip

5. Open a command prompt to the extracted release and run this command (Change steamerusername to the username of the Twitch channel)
`Assembly-CSharp.exe steamerusername data-old.dat data-new.dat`

6. The files should be combined into data-merged.dat. Use this file to overwrite your original data.dat and you're done!
